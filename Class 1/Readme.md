## 🌍 Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis

### **Objective**
This project evaluates the validity of the **Law of One Price** by examining cross-country price differences using The Economist’s *Big Mac Index* as a proxy for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).

---

### **Methodology**
- **Data Construction:** Manually recreated the 2015 Big Mac dataset using Python dictionaries to replicate raw international price data published by *The Economist*.  
- **Data Processing:** Used Pandas to structure the dataset, standardize currency units, and prepare variables for analysis.  
- **Implied PPP Calculation:** Computed each country’s *implied PPP exchange rate* by comparing local Big Mac prices to the U.S. price benchmark.  
- **Currency Misalignment Measurement:** Calculated the percentage **overvaluation** or **undervaluation** of each currency relative to the U.S. Dollar based on deviations from implied PPP.  
- **Economic Interpretation:** Assessed whether price deviations were consistent with global Purchasing Power Parity or indicative of arbitrage opportunities, market frictions, or structural economic differences.

### **Key Findings**
Your analysis indicates that:

- **[Insert finding—e.g., “The Norwegian Krone appeared overvalued by X% relative to the USD.”]**  
- **[Insert finding—e.g., “Emerging-market currencies such as the Brazilian Real showed significant undervaluation, suggesting deviations from PPP.”]**  
- **[Insert finding—optional]**

Overall, the results show that while PPP provides a useful long-run benchmark, short-run currency valuations can diverge substantially due to local cost structures, exchange-rate regimes, taxes, and market inefficiencies.

This lab demonstrates your ability to connect **economic theory** with **quantitative analysis**, applying real-world pricing data to evaluate international currency valuation through the lens of Purchasing Power Parity.
