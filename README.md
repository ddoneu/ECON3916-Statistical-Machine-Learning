# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my digital portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**.  
I am an undergraduate economics student passionate about applying **data-driven tools** to real-world economic and financial problems. My career interests include *Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance*, and this profile reflects my goal of bridging traditional economic theory with modern data science.

## 🧭 About this Portfolio

This repository contains my coursework, labs, and applied projects from ECON 3916.

The course follows a **“Concept Extension” approach**, where we begin with foundational statistical tools such as:

- Linear regression  
- Causal inference  
- Hypothesis testing  

…and extend them using modern **Machine Learning techniques**, including:

- Lasso & Ridge (regularization)  
- Nonlinear models  
- Out-of-sample evaluation and prediction  

By combining **causal inference** with **predictive analytics**, I am learning how economists can leverage machine learning to extract deeper insights and build more robust empirical models.
